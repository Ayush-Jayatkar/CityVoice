Here's a sample README file that incorporates the setup for both the Flask application and the Vite + React project:

---

# Project Setup and Guide

This project combines a **Flask** backend with a **Vite + React** frontend. Below are the steps to set up both environments and run the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (preferably version 3.8+)
- **Node.js** (for the Vite + React frontend)

### Check if Python is installed:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://python.org).

### Check if Node.js is installed:
```bash
node -v
# or
npm -v
```

If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## Flask Backend Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

   Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment active, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**

   Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Vite + React Frontend Setup

1. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   Navigate to your frontend directory and install the required Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/react-project
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Vite + React Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your React app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port is specified).

## Additional Information

- **Updating `requirements.txt`**: Ensure that `requirements.txt` is up to date with the installed Python packages. To update it, run:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- **Install Additional Python Packages**: To install additional dependencies in the backend, run:
  ```bash
  pip install package_name
  ```

- **Frontend Development**: For Vite + React, you can refer to the following official plugins:
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)
  - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)
